We will build a console application based on the following request:
---
{{$prompt}}
---

We need to determine the request body that will be used to hit the API URL below:
---
{{$appEndpoint}}
---

We also have some snippet from API documentation that might be useful:
---
{{$appSnippet}}
---

Please determine the request body and return in JSON Array format without any opening or closing words.
Don't assign all available properties to the JSON Array, please just include all of the REQUIRED properties to the JSON Array, and for the optional property in request body, you can ONLY add 1 to the JSON Array.

The JSON Array must be in this format:
[
	{
		"name": "property name",
		"type": "property data type",
		"isRequired": boolean value, either true or false
	}
]

For example:
[
	{
		"name": "property name 1",
		"type": "property data type",
		"isRequired": true
	},
	{
		"name": "property name 2",
		"type": "property data type",
		"isRequired": false
	},
	...
]
